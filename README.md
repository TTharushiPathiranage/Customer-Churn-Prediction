# Customer-Churn-Prediction

Introduction
Provides an overview of the importance of customer retention and the role of customer churn analysis in ensuring business growth and sustainability.

What is Customer Churn?
Explains the concept of customer churn, highlighting its impact on businesses and the metrics used to evaluate it.

How Can Customer Churn Be Reduced?
Outlines strategies and actionable insights to minimize customer churn, including personalized customer engagement, improving product quality, and leveraging predictive analytics.

Objectives
Defines the goals of the analysis, such as identifying churn patterns, building predictive models, and providing actionable recommendations.

Loading Libraries and Data
Details the tools and libraries (e.g., pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn) used for data analysis and machine learning, and describes the dataset being analyzed.

Understanding the Data
Explores the structure and features of the dataset, including column descriptions, data types, and summary statistics.

Visualize Missing Values
Utilizes visual tools (like heatmaps) to identify gaps in the dataset and assess the extent of missing information.

Data Manipulation
Describes techniques for handling missing values, transforming data types, encoding categorical variables, and creating new features if necessary.

Data Visualization
Leverages graphical representations (e.g., histograms, scatterplots, bar charts) to uncover trends and correlations that influence customer churn.

Data Preprocessing
Outlines the steps to prepare the data for machine learning, such as handling outliers, dealing with class imbalances, and normalizing data.

Standardizing Numeric Attributes
Explains the process of scaling numerical data to ensure uniformity and improve model performance.

Machine Learning Model Evaluations and Predictions
Focuses on applying various machine learning models to predict customer churn and comparing their effectiveness.

KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors)
A simple classification algorithm based on proximity to training data points.

SVC (Support Vector Classifier)
Builds a hyperplane or set of hyperplanes to separate data points into classes.

Random Forest
A robust ensemble model using multiple decision trees for improved predictions.

Logistic Regression
A statistical method for binary classification, predicting the likelihood of churn.

Decision Tree Classifier
A straightforward tree-based algorithm for making decisions based on feature splits.

AdaBoost Classifier
An ensemble method that combines weak learners iteratively to improve performance.

Gradient Boosting Classifier
A powerful machine learning model that builds trees sequentially to minimize prediction errors.

Voting Classifier
Combines multiple models (e.g., ensemble methods) to make more accurate predictions by averaging or majority voting.
